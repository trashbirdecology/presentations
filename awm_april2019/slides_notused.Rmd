- Globalization is leading to large-scale and long-lasting changes, including
    - climate change
    - urbanization
- And is creating novel ecosystemsThe consequences of globalization -- climate change, urbanization, habitat loss, etc.-- are expected to pave the way for novel ecosystems.

# Types of Regime Shifts  <!-- type plots -->


Given a system state $S$, and a driver, $D$, we can imagine a many potrential scenarios to evolve given shifts in $D$. 


[Dakos et al. 2014]


```{r rsTypesPlot}
# slow driver to tipping point
x = 1:10
  a =-1
  b = 4
  c = 10
S  = a*x^2 + b*x + c
D = mean(S)

p1<-myPlot(x = x, y1=S, y2=D, hline = D)+ 
  geom_line(aes(x = max(x):(max(x)+round(length(x)*.4)), # add flat line to end  
                y = min(S)), size = 1)+
  ggtitle("slow driver to tipping point")
# 
x = c(1:5, 5:10)
  a =  rep(10, 5)
  b =  c(rep(2, round(length(x)*.5,0)))
S = c(a,b)
D = mean(S)      

p2<-myPlot(x = x, y1=S, y2=D, hline = D)+
    ggtitle("slow driver to tipping point")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow=2)
```

Panel 1: slow driver to a tipping point
Panel 2:
Panel 3: 

<!-- Characteristics  -->
<!-- 1. at least two 'stable' states, stable of ecologically relevant time scale -->
<!-- 2. states are reinforce through some negative feedback -->
<!-- 3.  -->

Predicting systemic change is especially important when humans are negatively affected.

For example,  the bleaching and eventual death of this coral reef system impacts not only the wildlife within the reef system, but also has downstream impacts on human communities 
 - ecotourism (economy)
 - fisheries (food and economy)
 - nearshore barrier from extreme weather events (safety)
