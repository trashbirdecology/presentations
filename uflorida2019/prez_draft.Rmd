- I would argue that most ecologists (largely attributed to the way academics and many federal researchers are evaluated) focus on publishing their work as peer-reviewed research articles. This is great, but there are ohter ways to dissemminate their work and to promote the utility of their data. However, this model is static. 
- Another common step is to present research to different outlets, perhaps at various stages during the project's lifespan -- which may or may not influence the end product -- but unless these presentations occur at a stage of the project where feedback is easily incorporated -- the presentations are more or less self promotion (theres no shame in this as  Iw ill demonstrate at the end of this presentation...)
*****
- When projects are supported by stakeholders, if and how the product is beign used is a bit more obvious. 
- For the huge science products, e.g. those that the USGS creates and hosts/publishes, figuring this out is a bit more difficult
- Sure we can use web-based tracking metrics to figure this out, but 
- Tis makes getting feedback on if where and how the data is being used, or the potential and missing links of this a little bit more difficult
- My project at the usgs will attempt to tackle this issue, hopefully, in a few years time, having a roadmap for applied ecologists and those producing more basic data products a path for not ensuring, but increasing the probability that their data products are going ot be more broadly usefiul.

# Iterative Feedback from End-users & Decision Makers in the Data and Software Development
- FAIR data
- EarthMap
- Avoid the path of 'make software then shove in the face'
- Roadmap for research ecologists and modellers for efficiently gathering and incorporating end-user feedback into data products and tools
- 

???

- E.g., what would it take (hours, time, networks) for a research ecologist to reach out to *potential* end users of the data or software product -- is it worth their time? Is there a way we can make this more efficient (this is more of a career goal i think). This requires a cultural shift
- Moving beyond publish and perish model of data and software products -- I have seen this with my software already -- 
- In a business model -- typically we wouldnt waste our time creating products that wouldnt be used -- sure, but we as research ecologists often in a bubble, create products in isolation, getting feedback from our immediate peers who are most likely __not__ end-users of the product, who say yes thats awesome you should definitely do that. But in the business model, we wouldnt spend time and money and resources creating a product without determining the utility of the product -- e.g. through focus groups.

# Core Science Analytics, Synthesis & Libraries
__Vision__: Synthesize and deliver Earth system data and information.

--

__Mission__: Accelerate research and decisionmaking through data science, information delivery, advanced computing, and biodiversity analytics.

???

- I am currently in an innovative branch of the USGS, in teh Core Science Systems mission area. 
- Our team includes geologists, scientific and computer programmers, high performance computing teams, and an ecologist (raises hand)...
- Just being in this department as the only ecologist provides a unique opportunity for me to figure out how we, as fairly untrained ecologists, can streamline our data production and development -- putting me in a unique position to serve as 
- This also allows me to learn how to further my skills as a translational ecology
