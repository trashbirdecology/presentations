# Brief Overview of Past and Ongoing Research
???
- I am thrilled to be here, because as many of you know, I actually obtained my bachelors and my masterâ€™s degrees from this department!
- So, now the prodigal student has returned and she is super smart and has yet another tedious degree!
- So I'd like to give a brief overview of some of my past work, as I think it really sets the stage for how the stars have aligned with this postdoc, and how great of a fit this is for the USGS.

- Although numerous methods are proposed for identifying ecological regime shifts, these methods often produce false negatives, false positives, and rare do multiple methods produce similar results as to the location in time or space of an ecological regime shift. 
- In an attempt to get a bit closer to an understanding of when and where a method can be used, I applied numerous methods to empirical and simulated data. 
- Empirical multi-species time series, like this paleodiatom time series, are particvularly tricky when attempting to use some of the more established methods.

- A stylized version of the flow of a science or data product flows  is as follows:
  - maybe it starts at he collector and curator, someone analyzes it or makes inference from it
  - Next, if you're lucky, either the data or science product goes to a practitioner
  - And even more rarely does that science trickle up to the deicsion makers.

- Or how often do you seek feedback or try to identify the needs of end users?
- If never or rarely, there's reasonable explanations -

???
- I'd like to interject here with a quote from Joan Roughgarden -- which I stumbled across some time ago because I definitely wasn't purposefully reading this book:
  -  < read quote>
  - "most models in ecology are intended for other ecologists, cooked up by scientists, for consuption by other scientists". 
- This is really moving -- especially for someone who is a self-described science hermit who has yet to really, truly reach out to practitioners or decision makers to try to make her science relevant to societal needs. 
- I think it's fair to say that we can replace the word, models, here with other words, like 'data', 'results', 'articles', 'presentations', etc.

- Integrated population models are models which incorporate data from mark-recaptures and from abundance data (for example, BBS point counts)
- The beauty here, of course, is that one, to a certain degree, can combine data from disparate sources to estimate paramters within sub-models of the full population models
- Together, these two data can be used to synchronously estimate the true abundance of the population, by 
  - usign the BBL to inform apparent survival estimates, or phi
  - and using BBS to inform immigration & perhaps also observation errors.
