- I'd like to start my talk by relaying to you one of my favorite quotes from Joan Roughgarden: "most models in ecology are intended for other ecologists, cooked up by scientists, for consuption by other scientists". 
- When I first came across this quote -- and it definitely was a mistake because I definitely was not reading her book when I found it! -- I couldnt get it out of my head. 
- I think we can replace the word, models, here with other words, like 'data', 'results', 'articles', 'presentations', etc.

- Next year's theme is ...
- Not surprising given the amount and quality of data. 
- However, there's still much work to be done, especially on front of open science. 
- that is, full reproducibilty of our data, results, and other knowledge products
- And I have recently joined a branch within the USGS which is leading efforts to achieve such a culture within relevant sciences.
