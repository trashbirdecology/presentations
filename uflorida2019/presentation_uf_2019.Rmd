- In the business model -- we typically wouldn't waste money and time creating products without doing some sort of research, or like focus group to identify if and how the product would be used.
- Research ecologists wokr in bubble--create products in isolation--get feedback from eachother RATHER than the end-users!
- E.g., what would it take (hours, time, networks) for a research ecologist to reach out to *potential* end users of the data or software product -- is it worth their time? Is there a way we can make this more efficient (this is more of a career goal i think). This requires a cultural shift

- A typical trajectory of a science or data product flows from you, the data collector, curator, or manager --> research community --> maybe to practiioners
- If you're either lucky or the product is vital or really amazing, maybe it will trickle up to decision makers?

- But how often do practitioners influence your science?
- How often do you hear from praxctitioners?

- Or how often do you seek feedback or try to identify the needs of end users?
- If never or rarely, there's reasonable explanations - 
  - perhaps you conduct basic research, or are a natural historian
  - or maybe this is an overwhelming task that may not necessarily be rewarded within your community or profession?
- There's a reason for these question marks -- __this is a daunting task!__

- I'd like to start my talk by relaying to you one of my favorite quotes from Joan Roughgarden: "most models in ecology are intended for other ecologists, cooked up by scientists, for consuption by other scientists". 
- When I first came across this quote -- and it definitely was a mistake because I definitely was not reading her book when I found it! -- I couldnt get it out of my head. 
- I think we can replace the word, models, here with other words, like 'data', 'results', 'articles', 'presentations', etc.

- I recently (about 4 weeks ago today!) began a postdoc with the US Geological Survey
- I'd love to give you a brief overview of the mission area and branch that I am in, because 
    - I think it's a truly unique team, creating high impact foundational science products 
    - AND 
- Briefly, I am in a group of the Core Science Systems mission area of the USGS called Science Analytics and Synthesis.
