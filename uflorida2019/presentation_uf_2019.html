# Brief Overview of Past and Ongoing Research
???
- I am thrilled to be here, because as many of you know, I actually obtained my bachelors and my master’s degrees from this department!
- So, now the prodigal student has returned and she is super smart and has yet another tedious degree!
- So I'd like to give a brief overview of some of my past work, as I think it really sets the stage for how the stars have aligned with this postdoc, and how great of a fit this is for the USGS.

???
- I'd like to first start with an overview of my research to-date, including some ongoing projects
- B/c I think it will tell a nice story of how I've come to be in the position I am in now
- And how my previous works have influenced my perspective and appreciation for translational ecology, today.

- Eventually designing my own project wherein we used playbacks of screaming titmice to determine whether we could draw in hawks and owls.

- For example, the death or bleaching of a coral reef system impacts not only the ecological system itself, but also impacts the human communities relying on its health

- Although numerous methods are proposed for identifying ecological regime shifts, these methods often produce false negatives, false positives, and rare do multiple methods produce similar results as to the location in time or space of an ecological regime shift. 
- In an attempt to get a bit closer to an understanding of when and where a method can be used, I applied numerous methods to empirical and simulated data. 
- Empirical multi-species time series, like this paleodiatom time series, are particvularly tricky when attempting to use some of the more established methods.

- For example, the coefficient of variation, or the ratio of mean to variance over some period of time within an individual species, produces spaghetti plots

- Notably, in studying methods in detail, we identified a hidden method, rate of change of the distance travelled, sort of buried within the complicated steps of an alternative method. 
- We are calling this method, 'velocity', as it is a measure of the rate of change of an entire community, or multiple variables, over a period of time.

  - how are we communicating our data and science products
  - how can we improve or methods of communication, sharing, reproducibility, etc.?

- So, to date, my research, which I have really enjoyed, can be generalized as comprising the following:
  - data management
    - so how do we store, retrieve, manipulate, and share data
  - and the modelling efforts associated with specific data, places, species, and phenomenon

# Flow of Science Products and Knowledge
???
- But, as mentioned earlier, to make my science actionable requires understanding where my science is and is NOT going, and where I can make adjustments to improve its quality and dissemination. 
---
# Data and Science Products Often Flow Linearly
.center[
&lt;img src="/images/use_continuum/Slide1.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
???
- A stylized version of the flow of a science or data product flows  is as follows:
  - maybe it starts at he collector and curator, someone analyzes it or makes inference from it
  - Next, if you're lucky, either the data or science product goes to a practitioner
  - And even more rarely does that science trickle up to the deicsion makers. 
---
# Data and Science Products Often Flow Linearly
.center[
&lt;img src="/images/use_continuum/Slide2.png" width="100%" /&gt;

???
- But for many of us, how often can we say that practitioners are influencing our science, or the way we communicate our science?
- How often do you hear from praxctitioners?
- How often do __you reach out__? to pracitioners?
---
# Data and Science Products Often Flow Linearly

&lt;img src="/images/use_continuum/Slide3.png" width="100%" /&gt;

???
- Or how often do you seek feedback or try to identify the needs of end users?
- If never or rarely, there's reasonable explanations - 
  - perhaps you conduct basic research, or are a natural historian
  - or maybe this is an overwhelming task that may not necessarily be rewarded within your community or profession?
- There's a reason for these question marks -- __this is a daunting task!__

# &lt;!--Roughgarden Quote--&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&gt; 'Most models in ecology are inteded for other ecologists, cooked up by scientists for consumption by other scientists'   _Roughgarden (1979)_  

.footnote[[1] Theory of population genetics and evolutionary ecology: an introduction.]
???
- I'd like to interject here with a quote from Joan Roughgarden -- which I stumbled across some time ago because I definitely wasn't purposefully reading this book:
  -  &lt; read quote&gt;
  - "most models in ecology are intended for other ecologists, cooked up by scientists, for consuption by other scientists". 
- This is really moving -- especially for someone who is a self-described science hermit who has yet to really, truly reach out to practitioners or decision makers to try to make her science relevant to societal needs. 
- I think it's fair to say that we can replace the word, models, here with other words, like 'data', 'results', 'articles', 'presentations', etc.

- I'd love to give you a brief overview of the mission area and branch that I am in, because 
    - I think it's a truly unique team, creating high impact foundational science products 
    - AND 
- Briefly, I am in a group of the Core Science Systems mission area of the USGS called Science Analytics and Synthesis.
