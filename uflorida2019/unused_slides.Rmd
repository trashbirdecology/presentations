- Next year's theme is ...
- Not surprising given the amount and quality of data. 
- However, there's still much work to be done, especially on front of open science. 
- that is, full reproducibilty of our data, results, and other knowledge products
- And I have recently joined a branch within the USGS which is leading efforts to achieve such a culture within relevant sciences.

# Maximizing Federal Science Products & Translational Ecology
1. Publications (academic and popular)
1. Presentations/outreach
1. Software
1. Websites
???
- I would argue that most ecologists (largely attributed to the way academics and many federal researchers are evaluated) focus on publishing their work as peer-reviewed research articles. This is great, but there are ohter ways to dissemminate their work and to promote the utility of their data. However, this model is static. 
- Another common step is to present research to different outlets, perhaps at various stages during the project's lifespan -- which may or may not influence the end product -- but unless these presentations occur at a stage of the project where feedback is easily incorporated -- the presentations are more or less self promotion (theres no shame in this as  Iw ill demonstrate at the end of this presentation...)
*****
- When projects are supported by stakeholders, if and how the product is beign used is a bit more obvious. 
- For the huge science products, e.g. those that the USGS creates and hosts/publishes, figuring this out is a bit more difficult
- Sure we can use web-based tracking metrics to figure this out, but 
- This makes getting feedback on if where and how the data is being used, or the potential and missing links of this a little bit more difficult
- My project at the usgs will attempt to tackle this issue, hopefully, in a few years time, having a roadmap for applied ecologists and those producing more basic data products a path for not ensuring, but increasing the probability that their data products are going ot be more broadly usefiul.

# Iterative Feedback from End-users & Decision Makers in the Data and Software Development
- FAIR data
- EarthMap
- Avoid the path of 'make software then shove in the face'
- Roadmap for research ecologists and modellers for efficiently gathering and incorporating end-user feedback into data products and tools

1. The abundance data comes from teh North American Breeding Bird Sruvey.
  - Which is a roadside, annual point count
  - Takes place in the breeding months across much of the US and parts of Canada
2. And bird encounter histories from the North American bird banding program -- the Bird Banding Lab.
