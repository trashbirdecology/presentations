has broad enough appeal to generate large audiences (>250 people) at the meeting.
benefits broader society (for example through education, public policy, communication/public engagement, application to commercial technology, national security or international cooperation).
## Structure and organization
is explicitly more integrated than other oral sessions.
provides strong overall synthesis or overview; they should not be simply a set of related case studies.
avoids taking a narrow perspective on the symposium topic (organizers carefully avoid the appearance of biases toward their own perspectives).
builds a well-integrated whole (each talk should have clear relevance to the overall synthesis provided by the symposium).
