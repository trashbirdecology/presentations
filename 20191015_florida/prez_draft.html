# Talk Outline 
1. Introduction/About Me
  - WEC Alumni (B.Sc., M.Sc.) &lt;!-- i think this is important to cover as it has shaped my career and research interests, plus, its fun and might make a little bit more relatable. --&gt;
  - Science Analytics &amp; Synthesis, Core Science Systems
1. "Big Data" Ecology and Ornithology
1. Integrated Modelling in Ecology
1. Integrated Population Modelling
1. Communicating Results, Maximizing Science Products
1. Data and Software Product Development Efforts 
1. Shameless self-promotion &lt;!-- shameless plugs, software, research --&gt;

# About Me

- A montage (four quadrats maybe...)
  - Q2: Me and Katie or pic of TUTI 
  - Q1: 
  - Q3: 
  - Q4: 

???  
Either use four pictures, or just create one slide per job if I want to do papers produced

- I would argue that most ecologists (largely attributed to the way academics and many federal researchers are evaluated) focus on publishing their work as peer-reviewed research articles. This is great, but there are ohter ways to dissemminate their work and to promote the utility of their data. However, this model is static. 
- Another common step is to present research to different outlets, perhaps at various stages during the project's lifespan -- which may or may not influence the end product -- but unless these presentations occur at a stage of the project where feedback is easily incorporated -- the presentations are more or less self promotion (theres no shame in this as  Iw ill demonstrate at the end of this presentation...)
*****
- When projects are supported by stakeholders, if and how the product is beign used is a bit more obvious. 
- For the huge science products, e.g. those that the USGS creates and hosts/publishes, figuring this out is a bit more difficult
- Sure we can use web-based tracking metrics to figure this out, but 
- Tis makes getting feedback on if where and how the data is being used, or the potential and missing links of this a little bit more difficult
- My project at the usgs will attempt to tackle this issue, hopefully, in a few years time, having a roadmap for applied ecologists and those producing more basic data products a path for not ensuring, but increasing the probability that their data products are going ot be more broadly usefiul.

# Iterative Feedback from End-users &amp; Decision Makers in the Data and Software Development
- FAIR data
- EarthMap
- Avoid the path of 'make software then shove in the face'
- Roadmap for research ecologists and modellers for efficiently gathering and incorporating end-user feedback into data products and tools
- 

???

- E.g., what would it take (hours, time, networks) for a research ecologist to reach out to *potential* end users of the data or software product -- is it worth their time? Is there a way we can make this more efficient (this is more of a career goal i think). This requires a cultural shift
- Moving beyond publish and perish model of data and software products -- I have seen this with my software already -- 
- In a business model -- typically we wouldnt waste our time creating products that wouldnt be used -- sure, but we as research ecologists often in a bubble, create products in isolation, getting feedback from our immediate peers who are most likely __not__ end-users of the product, who say yes thats awesome you should definitely do that. But in the business model, we wouldnt spend time and money and resources creating a product without determining the utility of the product -- e.g. through focus groups.

# Core Science Analytics, Synthesis &amp; Libraries
__Vision__: Synthesize and deliver Earth system data and information.

--

__Mission__: Accelerate research and decisionmaking through data science, information delivery, advanced computing, and biodiversity analytics.

???

- I am currently in an innovative branch of the USGS, in teh Core Science Systems mission area. 
- Our team includes geologists, scientific and computer programmers, high performance computing teams, and an ecologist (raises hand)...
- Just being in this department as the only ecologist provides a unique opportunity for me to figure out how we, as fairly untrained ecologists, can streamline our data production and development -- putting me in a unique position to serve as 
- This also allows me to learn how to further my skills as a translational ecology

# Shameless Plugs
1. R package: `bbsAssistant`  
1. ESA 2020 : hopefully look out for an IPM session!
1. NAOC 2020: bbs &amp; bbl symposium or special session

# Let's Chat

1. Data integration
  - Avian point counts + mark-recapture  + environemntal
  - BBS + BBL
